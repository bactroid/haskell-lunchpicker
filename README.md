# lunch-picker

Slack app that picks a restaurant to eat at.

## Usage

To select a random restaurant with no constraints by user preference:

```
/lunch
```

To select a restaurant based on the preferences of the people attending:

```
/lunch @alice @bob @carol
```

## Features I want to add

* Ability to add and remove lunch places.
* Possibly a GitHub pages app to serve as an alternate interface.

## Wait…Wasn’t this Written in JavaScript?

Yeah. But then I figured out that I could use Haskell using
[serverless-haskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/serverless-haskell).
I prefer writing stuff in Haskell.
